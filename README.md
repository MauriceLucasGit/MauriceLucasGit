## 📈 Featured Projects

### 🏡 [End to End Machine Learning Project - Forecasting California Housing Prices](https://github.com/MauriceLucasGit/End-To-End-Machine-Learning-Project---Forecasting-California-Housing-Prices)
-  Built a production-oriented machine learning pipeline to predict California housing prices, implementing and comparing multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) using scikit-learn on features including geographic coordinates, property characteristics, and census district demographics.
-  Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing with Pandas (stratified sampling, missing value imputation, feature scaling with StandardScaler) and engineered domain-specific features (rooms per household, bedroom ratios, population density) informed by exploratory data analysis via Matplotlib visualizations to capture nonlinear relationships.
-  Optimized Random Forest regressor through k-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning, achieving deployment-ready predictions with measurable RMSE improvement over baseline models and housing expert pricing estimates, demonstrating the business value of systematic model selection and validation.

### 🔄 Subscription Cancellation Analysis
- Analyzed SaaS subscription funnel and cancellation patterns in Snowflake using SQL to identify churn drivers, optimize customer retention strategies, and improve conversion through cohort analysis for a fictitious B2B software company.

### 🎫NYC Parking Ticket Data Pipeline using dbt and SQL
- Developed dbt data pipeline to transform raw New York City parking ticket data into analytics-ready models using medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold layers).
- Practiced modern analytics engineering workflows including modular data modeling, automated testing, and version control.
